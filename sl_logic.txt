main()
	I created a struct that contains all game data.
		E.g. map, number of collectables, player position
	Initialize all variables in this struct using ft_calloc().
	Get the map path.
	Check arg input validity with check_input_validity().
	Read in the map with parse_map().
	Initialize the graphics library and create a Window with mlx_init().
	Store the paths to the game images with store_xpm_paths().
	Per image configure its data using mlx_xpm_file_to_image() and store in struct with load_xpm().
	Draw the map with draw_map().
	Check for user input using mlx_key_hook(). If found, parse using input().
	Check whether user closed the Window using red button. If so, stop game using stop_game().
	Put game stuck in a loop using mlx_loop().

check_input_validity()
	Checks whether right amount of arguments were provided.
	Checks whether the filename includes ".ber" somewhere.
	Checks whether the file ends with .ber extension.
	Checks whether the inputted map can be opened.

parse_map()
	Opens the map with open().
	Obtains the map dimensions with get_dim().
	Calculates the pixel lengths for the width and height of the Window.
	Reads map into memory with read_map_into_mem().

read_map_into_mem()
	Opens the map with open().
	Allocates memory for a new char * for each row in the map.
	For each row, run get_next_line() to read the map data.
	Close the map fd.

cell_loop()
	Function that loops over each cell in the map. Inside, it calls another
	function that has been passed as an argument.

	It is used to check the contents of the map.

store_xpm_paths()
	Simple function to store the paths to the .xpm files.

load_xpm()
	Simple function that prepares the mlx to work with the .xpm files
	with mlx_xpm_file_to_image(). Later images are drawn with mlx_put_image_to_window().

draw_map()
	Function iterates over each cell in the map, and then calls separate drawing
	functions. The drawing functions check for specific characters and act accordingly.

parse_input()
	Checks the user input and acts accordingly with mover().

stop_game()
	Calls mlx_destroy_window() and runs exit().
